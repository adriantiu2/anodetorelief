      In the printmaking studio I’m currently enrolled in, the woodblock is revered. We use Shina Plywood, a fine-grained wood from Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan. It is a popular choice amongst printmakers due to its lack of blemishes and soft, grainless quality that allows one to twist and turn their chosen gouging tool without much challenge. </p>
      <p>
      It was through carving into the noble woodblock that a memory (or memories) from somewhere between 2007 and 2010 came back to me. It described a scene of me sitting next to my dad on a dark, wooden bench, splintering away from hosting the sweaty basketball players that needed rest from playing on the court it was placed adjacent to. We had almost certainly just taken a break from a game of one on one basketball: my dad, although able to stand his ground in terms of making it a contested game, often couldn’t keep up with my energy in his old age and would have to call intermittent timeouts that I was never too fond of but allowed anyways, uncharacteristically sympathetic to his exhaustion. It was during these timeouts we would sit on this bench (always the one closest to the military guard parking lot as the other hoop was awkwardly placed in front of a busier street) and discuss some basketball thing or school thing, while I whittled away at a twig I had found in the grass patch that had 
      probably fallen from one of the large trees that canopied the rest area, foreshadowing some of the techniques I would use in my current printmaking class.</p><p>
      I used the silver swiss army knife my dad always kept in his pocket, switching between the straighter blade and the blade that was hooked at the end, which allowed for straighter lines at the expense of smooth cuts. It was silver but dulled with wear. Inevitably, rust had found its way between the miniature tools making each pull and prod a bit more laborious than the previous. It had history, but not as much as it could have. I recall an anecdote (at a point even earlier in my life to where I don’t remember if it was told to me as a tale or if I had witnessed it first hand) where my dad’s swiss army knife was confiscated by security at an airport at the baggage check. He had brought it without really thinking about it, as it had become a part of his pocket (it’s imprint had molded itself into the cloth since he tended to wear a single pair of pants for days on end). I remember he was upset about it and tried to convince the security people that it did not pose a threat to the general public, but of course the rules at an airport are justifiably non negotiable and it was swiftly taken. Therefore, to my understanding, I had been using a second edition of the original swiss army knife, seeing that immediately after the incident he had purchased the same exact model to replace the confiscated one.</p><p>
      Oftentimes I would just shave the bark off the twig and leave it at that. After all, it was no thicker than a chicken bone and thus didn’t allow for the sculptural forms I had probably envisioned. Other times, I would make sure to scrape away every knob and void visible to the naked eye in order to make a flawless, miniature pillar which I would have kept in a plastic drawer in my room. Supposedly, it was my intention to create something grandiose out of all of the ones I had kept, though I really wasn’t ever sure what. I took a liking to carving these twigs after taking interest in (and eventually purchasing) a series of small, wooden models in Chinatown that were encased in a plastic box no more than three inches tall and depicted a pagado or a bamboo forest or some other rustic, East Asian vignette. I was impressed by how meticulous it was; how the ridges of the roof or the texture of the leaves were so insisted upon. How something so fragile could tell a story. </p><p>
      The act of cutting into something at that scale was also so accessible which was enticing to a young, hands-on boy like myself. There was no industrial printer needed or any sort of complex skill that needed to be learned. I’m sure there were tools that were used, but nothing a swiss army knife couldn’t replace, albeit with a bit more patience. I also happened to enjoy working small and meticulously on creative pursuits, a concept that contradicted the impatient and ill tempered attitude I once had (or perhaps still do). In that way, it was similar to my origami ventures (yet another art form I was quite invested in when I was younger) but with a bit more permanence, for it wasn’t paper and it couldn’t be crumpled.</p><p>
      Like the models I had found in Chinatown, I was also probably interested in carving away a city or a landscape of my own. Maybe to house the little samurai figurines I had just recently painted; perhaps a barracks to shelter them from my Italian or American or German or Japanese WWII soldier figurines that were of comparable size. It also could have been a model of my own. Maybe a creature or soldier of my own imagination because then it’s abilities and attributes were up to me and did not have to be regulated by the rules of real life. Or the sticks would just be sticks and the marvel itself would be the memory it symbolized, but of course that was a difficult sell for a boy who enjoyed the tangibility of things.
      As the stack of shaven sticks continued to idly pile up in my drawer, my own ambitions for a wooden dystopia began to dwindle. It was as I had gotten older that the imaginative possibilities started to become more challenging to conjure up in a mind that was growing to be increasingly tethered to reality. Eventually I had stopped the woodcutting between basketball games altogether and then eventually the basketball games had stopped altogether. My dad had stopped playing with me on a regular basis, not because of anything other than the two of us growing older. My body had become a bit more brash and thus his breaks became a bit more frequent to the point where there was more rest time than there was gameplay.  And so, the twigs stopped becoming sticks and the sticks stopped becoming wood.</p><p>
      In my printmaking studio, we have hand tools that help expedite the cutting process, with much more of an emphasis on gouging rather than shaving or whittling. There is no bark on the wood and the surface is flat with hardly a blemish. The carving is done inside, alone with headphones in and not on a basketball court bench next to family. It was difficult to pin down what exactly was so reminiscent, then. Alas, after much thought, I discovered it was the shavings, the negative space that is ultimately discarded, that was nostalgic of the sticks I was once involved with. The part that is eventually gathered up in a pile and wiped off into a trash can.</p><p>
      The court that me and my dad had once played on is being bulldozed as I write this. The park it once resided in was a small piece of a middle school that is being rebuilt, so the entire plot of land is being razed to the ground. A massive pile of dirt the height of three basketball hoops sits in the middle of it all. The kids that would have attended the school in the fall will be relocated to a different school in the meanwhile. Supposedly, the renovations will be done four years from now and the school will be better than ever: probably equipped with a slew of new, well paved basketball courts with unworn benches and crystal clear backboards. But for now, the trees that once lined the court are just stumps.</p>
